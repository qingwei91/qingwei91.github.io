## My random thoughts

* Efficient organization should be organized like clean code, leader should be able to use people like an API, where implementation details are hidden, and only results are reported back
* Code architecture is more important than code style
* Sometimes you have to make decision without all information you need, this is almost always better than not making decision
* The fundamental benefits of software is that software is extremely malleable, and we should focus on flexibility when building software
* Ability to write well is key to scaling engineering organization
* Knowledge is one of the most important asset of a software engineering organization, organization should have a strategy to store, retrieve, and communicate knowledge, and code is NOT the best way
