# 01~12/01/2020
## What happened?
Not able to make much progress on things I am learning, I think I need to cut down something

## How you feel?
I felt a bit discouraged by not making progress, but I am now feeling better!

## What have you learn?
* Scalajs is a PITA, do not pick it unless you're able to save a lots of code, or if your app is complex in logic but does not requires quick UI feedback loop while developing
*
