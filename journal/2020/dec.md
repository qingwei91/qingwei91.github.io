## How do I feel?
I felt really good at the beginning of my holiday, but then I start to feel anxiety in the middle of it because I was fear to get back to work. This is terrible.

My week started ok but turned south real quick, a list of things gone wrong:

1. Not having Watson Integration setup earlier for Publishers
2. Fandom Watson integration isnt going to work well
3. Model built for 1st client isnt working at all

## What have I done?

## What have I learned?

Data project is really hard, and we probably should acquired relevant talent before taking a stab
