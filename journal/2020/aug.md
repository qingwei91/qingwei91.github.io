# 01 - 24 / 08 / 2020

Lolz, the month is almost finished and I only started to write

A few things happened:
* We committed to new way of collaboration for open ended project
* I ran quarter retro, seems to be useful
* I thought a bit more about building our own Text Categorization which is fun

## What I've learned:

1. Partition is the execution unit in Spark, no of partition and data size of partition represent a trade-off between parallelism, memory usage and schedulign overhead
2. Accessing spark ui on DataProc is quite difficult but absolutely crucial
3. Not all data are linearly separable, with dubious data quality, it is extremely difficult to build a decent model
4. Focus on things we can control is key to emotional stability
