# What?

We went to Rome, it was great. We both feel loved. Vinny is a great company, grateful to have him as guest.

Work entered a relatively stressed period due to pressure to complete, I think on hindsight we could've prioritize things better.
Quite a few things break:

1. Memory leak issue that's hard to debug
2. Usage of iceberg was too complicated and lead to backtracking the decision
3. Also got stressed out on a side project that I couldnt get it working properly, inviting mistrust from boss which makes me feel sick, need to deal with this better

In terms of personal growth:
1. I started reading equities research, not sure if I am getting any profit from it, but its interesting
2. Stopped learning about finances, it can get a bit boring at times
3. Still struggle to find my next growth point

# Specific learnings

1. It is somewhat important to consider fitting into team in interview, trust my feeling
2. Be more proactive in project justification, I think one thing we didnt do enough is to ask what else should we/I do?
3. Growth in stock is very important, the best growth comes when you catch a grow stock before valuation increase which result in a double whammy

# What's next?

First I sure want to finish current migration! Dont let it overrun massively.

Then I want to continue my path as a Rust Learner, maybe build an application that I can show off instead of building tool.
Options:

1. Multiplayer snake game
2.
