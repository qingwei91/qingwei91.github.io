## What happened?
N/A

## How you feel?
Oops

## What have you learn?
* Distributed lock is really distributed lease, to make it work, the resource that requires mutex needs to be part of the system and be able to verify if a lease expired or not using a monotonic token  
* Avoid making decision on your own
* Reject/Escalate informal external request
* Salt is a randomly generated data that's stored along the hash, in Bcrypt, it is stored as part of the hash so developer does not need to deal with it explicitly
