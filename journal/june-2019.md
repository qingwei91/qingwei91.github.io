Electricity went off

## How you feel?
Nice

## What have you learn?
* 4 chicken thighs == 2 separate sessions, or use a bigger pan (cast iron), else the temperature will be unstable and chicken might be overcooked
* Start making notes when learning
* 2 Phase Locking is commonly used to implement serializability, and it has nothing to do with 2 Phase Commits

## How you feel?
Oops

## What have you learn?
* Distributed lock is really distributed lease, to make it work, the resource that requires mutex needs to be part of the system and be able to verify if a lease expired or not using a monotonic token  
* Avoid making decision on your own
* Reject/Escalate informal external request
* Salt is a randomly generated data that's stored along the hash, in Bcrypt, it is stored as part of the hash so developer does not need to deal with it explicitly

## What have you learn?
* Efficient organization is like nice code architecture, it focus on clean abstraction that does not leak, there should be clear boundary between leader and member so that things can scale easily, for it to work, leader should trust members, and be explicit about the expectation
* To scale a software team, we need to put in effort when designing architecture, communication is often the bottleneck of scaling, to scale, it makes sense to focus on reducing communication, especially synchronous communication, microservices is an organization pattern to achieve this, having extensive documentation is another way, it is also beneficial to have code designed to be easy splittable so that multiple individuals can work on them separately and only depends on api
* Bernouli distribution == random variable with yes/no
* Binomial distribution allow one to answer question like `what's the probability for event A to produce k success over n trials`, assuming each trial is independent
* View frustum is a pyramid-like space that will be render by 3d graphic engine, it is defined by `field of view, aspect, near and far end`
    - field of view is the angle of the view
    - aspect is a three.js specific idea, representing the ratio of the screen
    - frustum is encapsulated between near and far end
* Cassandra resolve Last Write Win, but by each column
* Real time processing means you lose a lot of flexibility on aggregating events over time

## What have you learn? 
* 2d graphic basics: Create sprite and manipulate it
* Sprite is graphical component that can be control by code, it is typically image but not necessary

# 12-6-2019

## What happened?
Job hunt seems to fail

## How you feel?
Confused, I think I've been focusing on the wrong thing 

## What have you learn? 
* Many times it is easier said than done, so if you're making a request that you dont fully know how to achieve, it is better to make a head start on the work to lay the foundation  
* UDP does not have request response semantic

## What happened?
Spend sometime to work on interview skills 

## How you feel?

## What have you learn?
* Events aggregation is stateful
* One can convert stateful program to stateless function as long as you dont need to share states concurrently, if everything happens in sequences, then the state can be factor out using recursion or some helpers that propagates states over the loop. If you need to access the state concurrently, then you either need to share a mutable reference (eg. Ref) or use some message passing facilities (eg. Actor, Queue, PubSub)
* Unbounded sessions cannot be aggregated without information lost, as aggregation needs to complete at sometime, but you cannot determine if sessions completed or not
* Api design rule: Low level api should reflects facts, high level api should reflects intent, facts rarely changes, but intent always change as business always want to do different things
* Dynamic programming tips:
    - Find recursive relationship, where f(n) = X*f(n-1) + c
    - Cache all results in some data structure with constant time access (2d Array as table, more dimension if needed)
* Divide and Conquer technique can reduce complexity from N to log N
