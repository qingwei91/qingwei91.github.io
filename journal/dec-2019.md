## What happened?
Went for a nice trip, been away for a while

## How you feel?
Great

## What have you learn?
* I get jealous over other's successes, not sure if it is jealousy or some sort of unsecure, but I need validation, be it external or internal
* I am motivated to learn, and thus I always try to build something that is relatively new to me to get the dopamine high when learning stuff, this helps me to be a better engineer but is a hindrance to actually build anything useful, I am a bit too lazy, I guess the solution is to be organized
* Su is insecure, I have yet found out how to help, but I am hoping we can make each other accountable so that we actually accomplish something, I think that is super important
