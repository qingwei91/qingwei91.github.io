## What happened?

When to Italy, was beautiful. Prod release of IPRT still stuck, I am a bit anxious.

## How you feel?

Nothing special lately, I think so far its fine. My learning of Rust has slowed down a bit, need to pick it up.

## What have you learn?

I've learned that we can cross-compile Rust using rustup tool chain, but I dont know how it actually work, not super important for me currently. The assertion macro from rust does not seems to produce nice error message, its a shame.

choivocapital.com is quite detailed, good source of info.
