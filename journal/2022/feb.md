## What happened?

Started in Zendesk for 2 weeks now, there are some parts that are terrible and some parts that are decent.

The system is arcane and worse, no known way to fix, its a combination of 
* Old, badly written code
* Unspecified/unknown behavior
* Super large surface area, its equivalent to a query language, and its not clear how many different components there are and how do they compose

## How do I feel?
While I am a bit worried about efficiency, I am able to cope because the problems are not caused by me, and I have no intention to stay for long.

## What have I learned?
This is probably the worst code I've seen so far, which really shows how complex code can hurt the team.

I learn that I want to join a place that the team is moving fast and effective, or I am given the oppoturnity and space to build such team.

My biggest challenge here will be:

1. Help the team to be better at prioritization and stay focus
2. Help the team to better understand the system code and logic, I think we can maybe start from identifying parts that we dont understand

What are something worth learning from Zendesk?
I havent seen many impressive stuff tbh, but there are few note-worthy one:
1. Decent onboarding that stress on values and priorities, I guess this is crucial for a company this large to somewhat align people
2. Some of those infrastructure are pretty handy, like Okta
3. A good design review (RFC) culture
