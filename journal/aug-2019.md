# 1-26 /8/ 2019

## What happened?
Terrible month, fighting for D23 launch, requirement changes all the time, design changes all the time, mood swing happen more frequently on me

## How you feel?
There are moments when I hate my job, I am learning to keep a distance with it to keep sanity

## What have you learn?
* Clear expectation is important for a team to success, if there are things that isn't clear, we should be upfront and tell everyone that it is expected to be flux because we haven't figure things out, and there need to be someone accountable to get it sorted
* I should not be too attached to work, especially when things aren't going in a way I like, it is more important for me to improve than to work my ass off for people that dont care about me
* sbt jvm remote debugging does not work on Forked JVM
* Contravariant is useful when you want to extract information on input type instead of return type (in contrast with Functor)
* Raft cluster membership is not trivial as I thought, treating cluster membership as part of the replicated state is problematic, because Raft assumes that **semantic of replicated state is not impacted by when a log is applied**, it only cares about if a log is replicated in a quorum, and consequently if the log is committed at Leader, a log can be committed and stay unapplied for a good amount of time. This is fine for normal state, but not for membership (or more generally any information that affect Raft's control flow), a cluster can get into a state where some of the followers have not applied the latest cluster memship change and thus incorrectly form a quorum, eg. real cluster contains node 1,3,4, but 3 is slow to apply config change and still think cluster contains 1,2,3, and forms a quorum with 2 (which should be removed). One **possible** way to solve this problem is to force nodes to apply latest config change before participating any other config change and election.
