# 1-28 /8/ 2019

## What happened?
Terrible month, fighting for D23 launch, requirement changes all the time, design changes all the time, mood swing happen more frequently on me

## How you feel?
There are moments when I hate my job, I am learning to keep a distance with it to keep sanity

## What have you learn?
* Clear expectation is important for a team to success, if there are things that isn't clear, we should be upfront and tell everyone that it is expected to be flux because we haven't figure things out, and there need to be someone accountable to get it sorted
* I should not be too attached to work, especially when things aren't going in a way I like, it is more important for me to improve than to work my ass off for people that dont care about me
* sbt jvm remote debugging does not work on Forked JVM
* Contravariant is useful when you want to extract information on input type instead of return type (in contrast with Functor)
