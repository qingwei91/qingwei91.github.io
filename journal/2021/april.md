## What have I learned?

### Reading The Hard things about hard things
I am reading `The hard things about hard things`, it is a good read as it is easy to digest, and the part about what makes good product manager vs bad product manager is very insightful.

Training is important and it is the responsibility of manager, we should consider it a priority, as a manager things that does not get prioritize typically dont happen.
Training is important even for small company. I think we can frame training as activities that increase employee's productivity by increasing their knowledge.
Such knowledge can include:
1. Techniques & Skills
2. Domain knowledge
3. Technical knowledge about system

Good product manager:
1. Take full responsibility
2. Responsible to devise and execute a winning plan
3. Lead the product team
4. Define target
5. Always give direction and information formally
6. Take written position on important issues
7. Think in terms of delivering superior value
8. Define their job and success

On hiring, a key insight is to hire for strenght and not lack of weakness, it is more useful to hire someone with outstanding ability even if she has weaknesses on some area (within reason), because it is those strength that can really help push the organization to success, not lack of weakness.

### Data structure and algorithm

### Importance of Process Optimization (find multiplier)
I started to look into why China Internet company requires 996 and still didnt appear to fully outcompete their west counterpart, and reach 2 conclusions:

1. Company in the west (probably really mean US) care more about proper planning and good management, this mean to only work on important features, and optimizing the process
2. US internet company exists longer and thus are putting more effort in underlying infrastructure, such practices pay good dividend for a very long time.

## What happened?

Entering purely tech work now, less pressure on meeting product goal

## How do I feel?

Anxiety can still come in many directions, more so when I want to deliver something.
I realize I am fearful, I need to be brave and stand up on what I believe, in a respectful way.

## What have I learned?

I had a debate with my boss, she thinks not being explicit is somewhat better, but I couldnt gauge her argument, and it makes me think it is likely politically charged.
I think it is useful to watch out about such dynamic, I dont agree with such stance based on the current info though.

### The distinction between 1 and 2
1 are people that are comfortable to make decision without enough knowledge, and tend to be visionary.
2 are people that are less comfortable to make decision without enough knowledge, and tend to be operationally oriented.

Based on my feeling, I am probably type 2 which is why I demand structure in place, I want to know what should I spend time thinking of, and to what extent.

### I am starting to feel tired when dealing with people
I think there are times where I am simply not trusting people, and there are times where people are not trusting me. These things add frictions and reduce my energy.
