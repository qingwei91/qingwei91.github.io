## What happened?
Making progress to restructure effort, making progress on Socio Demo project

## How do I feel?
Feeling good about work, a bit uncertain though. I am not confident enough.

Not feeling good about personal technical improvement, I havent wrote interesting code for a while, and havent learnt much lately.

## What have I learned?
It is important to admit defeat and start afresh.

I am not taking enough ownership, I am not treating the project as mine enough, I should've push it towards the direction I want, but instead I frequently defer to CTO and Product because I didnt know thats what I should be doing.

I should avoid to be in a fight or flight situation, I should make space for myself to think more strategically. I've been playing safe too much.

Planning for planning is very much needed, we should think about a task/goal/project with 2 dimension (at least).

* Uncertainty
* Complexity

Where uncertainty should come 1st, uncertainty is like a fog that cover whatever we know with a layer of probabilistic cloud, and we should not start the work on something until uncertainty is low enough.

## What happened?
Team restructuring went well. 
Discover issues in our new home.

## How do I feel?
Feel good about work, upset about the situation of our home.
Continue to feel uncertain about future, I observed this notion causes big damage when things are not smooth. It hints that I need to be more resilent.

## What have I learned?
* I confirmed that people appreciate my organization skills.
* I internalize an important factor to determine prioritization is the view/vision required for a task, if a task requires something that only I know/have then I have to prioritize that, otherwise I should look to delegate
* It is great to have slack, it helps clear up mind, a similar observation can probably be made in queue system

## What happened?
Failed to solve the tech interview which is expected XD
Getting back to work and while I still struggle to wake up, going through it feels a lot better.

## How do I feel?
I need to realize I have options, I have choices and I am an adult that can bear responsibility.

I can fail and I dont have to live up to anyone's expectation, perhaps with the exception of mine. It is more important for me to follow my heart and do the right thing and see how things unfold.

## What have I learned?
Composability is probably a fundamental attribute to many great stuffs, to be able to scale an organization effectively, we need to be able to compose and decompose work. I am just amazed that as time goes, the more I realize composability is fundamental XD

I think I did a good job on prioritizing and managing stuff after I am back, a lot of this can be contributed to having Product to own prioritization so that I dont need to figure it out.

I think I am quite good at debugging, partly because I did it a lot, is there anything I can extract from it?

## What happened?
A hectic week, plenty of things get thrown at me

## How you feel?
I feel ok, it helps to be an observer and look at things as it happens.
Most thing shall pass, and whatever happening on me couldnt be smaller.

## What have you learn?

* Product delivery is only a part of a managerial role, I actually have 3 concerns:
    - Achieving Product Delivery Goal
    - Establishing process to make subsequent iteration easier
    - Think about the cost of delivery, operating cost, maintainence cost and future development cost
