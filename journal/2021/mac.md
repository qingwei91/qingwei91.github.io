## What happened?
Making progress to restructure effort, making progress on Socio Demo project

## How do I feel?
Feeling good about work, a bit uncertain though. I am not confident enough.

Not feeling good about personal technical improvement, I havent wrote interesting code for a while, and havent learnt much lately.

## What have I learned?
It is important to admit defeat and start afresh.

I am not taking enough ownership, I am not treating the project as mine enough, I should've push it towards the direction I want, but instead I frequently defer to CTO and Product because I didnt know thats what I should be doing.

I should avoid to be in a fight or flight situation, I should make space for myself to think more strategically. I've been playing safe too much.

Planning for planning is very much needed, we should think about a task/goal/project with 2 dimension (at least).

* Uncertainty
* Complexity

Where uncertainty should come 1st, uncertainty is like a fog that cover whatever we know with a layer of probabilistic cloud, and we should not start the work on something until uncertainty is low enough.
