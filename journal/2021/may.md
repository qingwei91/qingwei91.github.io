# 01 - 30 / 05 / 2021

## What happened?

* 2 weeks past and the team seems to be working better, with less direction required
* Had retro to better understand pain points

## How do I feel?
* A little bit of weird feeling with a team member over-involvement

## What have I learned?

1. Reiterating Andy Grove, when I delegate, I still need to follow up and look into the blackbox from time to time to make sure things are going as expected.
2. I still dont have a good way to gauge capacity need, thanks my manager to always have a focus on this
3. Maintaining good relationship sometimes is as simple as communicating our needs and establish a way moving forward, sometime we need to sarcrifice and it is important to communicate them.
4. I sometime incorrectly assume my team understand what needs to be done and got it wrong, I need to figure out why and how to avoid this.
5. I need to constantly avoid team to get into multitasking but sometime it is harder to avoid.
