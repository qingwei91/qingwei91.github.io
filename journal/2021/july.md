## What happened?
I am having a week where we are not sprinting, it felt great, probably should do it more often

My counter-part is also behaving nicer, guess the feedback is helping

## How you feel?
Feel good for work but a bit disappointed about personal side project and work


## What have you learn?
Focus on strength while managing weakness is a great way to live, it helps everyone and bring joy, and it might actually be better.

I should incorporate this idea into my interview process.

I've learned more about BigQuery, specifically the sliding window pattern.

Copilot looks really cool, and appears to open up new ways to work.

I learned to not take proactive stand, because my counter-part does not appreciate and does not tend to follow up.

### What do I not like in this job?
* Having to deal with Product person that are not proactive
* I dont like to deal with competing priorities without good framework
* I dont like being behind of workload
* I dont like to prepare for interview
* I dont like to having to keep switching focus

## What happened?

## How you feel?
As of writing, I am feeling good, but there was a period of time that I felt terrible. 

Part of it is that I feel I am overworked, but it has loosen up a bit lately. In addition, we made some progress so I am happy.

## What have you learn?
It is important to have someone willing to listen, sometime that alone can do a lot for people under stress and provide hope.

Data Scientists are a luxury, to make full use of Data Scientist, we need to have good support, they need:

1. Easy access to data
2. Easy access to compute
3. Good understanding of business
4. Ability to gather more data from Prod
5. Ability to alter prod, do A/B test

Many of these are traditionally controlled by Developer and Infra team, and Data Scientist might not have the right expertise to perform the work
