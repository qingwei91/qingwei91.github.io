## What happened?
Terrible month, fighting for D23 launch, requirement changes all the time, design changes all the time, mood swing happen more frequently on me

## How you feel?
There are moments when I hate my job, I am learning to keep a distance with it to keep sanity

## What have you learn?
* Clear expectation is important for a team to success, if there are things that isn't clear, we should be upfront and tell everyone that it is expected to be flux because we haven't figure things out, and there need to be someone accountable to get it sorted
* I should not be too attached to work, especially when things aren't going in a way I like, it is more important for me to improve than to work my ass off for people that dont care about me
* sbt jvm remote debugging does not work on Forked JVM
* Contravariant is useful when you want to extract information on input type instead of return type (in contrast with Functor)
* Raft cluster membership is not trivial as I thought, treating cluster membership as part of the replicated state is problematic, because Raft assumes that **semantic of replicated state is not impacted by when a log is applied**, it only cares about if a log is replicated in a quorum, and consequently if the log is committed at Leader, a log can be committed and stay unapplied for a good amount of time. This is fine for normal state, but not for membership (or more generally any information that affect Raft's control flow), a cluster can get into a state where some of the followers have not applied the latest cluster memship change and thus incorrectly form a quorum, eg. real cluster contains node 1,3,4, but 3 is slow to apply config change and still think cluster contains 1,2,3, and forms a quorum with 2 (which should be removed). One **possible** way to solve this problem is to force nodes to apply latest config change before participating any other config change and election.

## What happened?
Nothing much

## How you feel?
More relaxed, thank god

## What have you learn?
* I learned 2 more ways to perform model checking
   - Build a lineage graph with validation, which compute possible path based on what happened, example, given a program that performs OpA, OpB, OpC in sequence, we compute a state graph like this
        If OpA succeeded, then OpB is allowed to have these X paths
        If OpA failed, then OpB is allowed to have these Y path
   - Implement an in memory version of the abstract machine you're testing, then update the abstract state machine according to the response of the actual test, but I am not sure how to model multiple possibility in such model, as distributed system can timeout, which creates a fork in your model, ie. It either work or didn't, we dont know 
* NP Problem is Non-deterministic polynomial problem, it is a formal specification for problems that can be solve in polynomial time (relative to input size) on a Non-deterministic Turing Machine, a Non-deterministic Turing Machine is an imaginery machine where every computation can have multiple outcome and thus the result is non-deterministic. Informally, NP Problem can be solved by conventional computer in exponential time.

## What happened?
My comment was interpreted as unprofessional, it stems from me making request from coworker and came across as unreasonable.

## How you feel?
I feel hurt, while there's some truth about I can go on and illustrate how to make things nicer, I thought I've shown it enough in the past, and I certainly dont feel people put enough effort into achieving it. I also suspect such expression is a form of retaliation. But I decided to move on and not get into a fruitless argument. 

## What have you learn?
* I am still way too easy to be hurt, suspect it is related to my energy level, training intensity and work satisfication in general, at the same time, I need to be empathy about others, people can make remarks that they would never do in normal situation when they are tired, worn out.
* Also I should get back into the mental habit of thinking long term, most things is not going to matter in 5 years time, heck, most things wont matter in 5 weeks, all situations are temporary and things will either improve or get worse, dont worry and sit it through

# 29/9/2019

## What happened?
I spent most time going through backlog, making sure we know what we need to do

## How you feel?
Relatively calm, but still not energetic enough

## What have you learn?
* Model checking is a general technique where it model a system as automaton (FSM), and go through every possible transition and make sure certain properties hold all the time
* Formal definition of Linearizability [link](../../learning-notes/linearizability.md)
