## What happened?
Got back to work, yee haw

## How you feel?
Fine

## What have you learn?
* 1 hour is very short if I wasn't focusing
* Debugging raft is still a pain, it constantly push me out of the flow
* ichi, ni, sa n, yo n, shi ro, a ka, o ha i u, ha i
* Prefer duplicating events over having to merge events, because merging events is more complicated due to time sensitivity, and different consumer might merge them differently

## What happened?
Nothing much

## How you feel?
Bored

## What have you learn?
* `a o` is blue in japanese
* Contention is costly when using lock-free primitive, raft-scala appeared to get stuck for tens of seconds if we spam it with request 
* Random assignment and random sampling is different and both is used to mitigate confounders, an ideal experiment should use both technique
* I regretted our choice on domain events, I think we should provide a  query api to external if they are interested in data at rest, and have dedicated pipeline for notification
* It appears fs2.Topic does not work as I expected
* I am holding the opinion that any architectural changes should undergo some form of RFC process  
* Dynamo global table conflict resolution is local to each replica, it should be reasonable to assume that events emission is part of transaction of state change, and conflict resolution by it's nature is not, and thus events is guaranteed to be emitted even in case of conflict resolution

* Mirroring data should always be accompanied with data source, avoid bidirectional state change
* Keep a list of key and check google trend periodically to understand sentiment

## What have you learn?
* Box plot visualize robust statistics and attempt to show outlier using the idea of whisker 
* ya sai = vegie in Japanese  
* When facing concurrent bug, try to use single-thread threadpool to see if it solves the problem, if it does, chances of lock related problem increases

I feel stucked, I am not sure why am I staying, and what is the point of the work. I dont know what do I own, it is not clear how responsibility is being divided, and this feel awful for me.

I guess I thrive when the goal is clear or I am responsible to find out the goal

## What have you learn?
* Caching password isn't a good idea, in fact caching anything that needs to be always consistent is bad
