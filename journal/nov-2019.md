## What happened?
Nothing much, things are falling into places

## How you feel?
Not bad

## What have you learn?
* Push harder for small, independent work, the risk of big piece of work is simply too high
* When rewriting application, it is better to use a declare low level, implement high level layer, the idea is that you really want to implement high level layer to have a better idea of what low level primitive is needed
* Async Resource safety is tricky (TODO: I need to write it out)

## What happened?

## How you feel?
A bit bored

## What have you learn?
* There's no nice way to cancel a while loop, in JVM one can kill the thread, if we are using IO then we can cancel a flatMap loop 
* Linearizability check can be reduced to sequential consistency, sequential consistency means that order within a thread/client is guaranteed, but it does not guarantee order across clients, meaning stale read is possible but you will guarantee to read your own write, check this [blog](http://rystsov.info/2017/02/15/simple-consensus.html)

## What happened?

I resigned, and I am really grateful for all the kind words.

## How you feel?

Relieved, more and more things are getting done, that's great

## What have you learn?
I learn something important about myself, is that I have the tendency to cut things out, it might because I am an engineer and hate complexity, or it might because I am a minimalist deep down. I am not sure if this is a great trait as it seems to be at odds with Product mindset. I will need to be more aware of such behaviour and explicitly challenge myself whenever my instinct kicks in.
