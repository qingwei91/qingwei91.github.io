# 1-2 /7/ 2019

## What happened?
Went to Copenhagen

## How you feel?
A bit hectic

## What have you learn?
* Avoid dragging on decision when it affects others, case in point, me not knowing if I want to lead a new team or continue to work under Matt/Neil
 
# 3-4/7/ 2019

## What happened?
Had an interview

## How you feel?
Tiring, but OKay 

## What have you learn?
* It is great to know what is expected from you, in a well-defined manner
* There's a product data type that can represent multiple branch at the same time, and one can use that with Free
* Worth to learn a bit more about Free
* It is crucial to split work into pieces and make sure they are at the same level of abstraction, mixing abstraction levels increase cognitive load due to constant diving in and out abstractions, and it also creates a dependencies mess in the unit of work
* `Bind(io, f)` is flatMap, complexity comes from evaluation

# 5-7 /7/ 2019

## What happened?
Got the offer <3

## How you feel?
Still tiring 

## What have you learn?
* Sometimes I need to stand up and confirms action
* Use profile to understand performance!! 
* If you care about performance then it's important to keep evaluation in mind, sometimes codes are evaluated without being useful, typically when things are eager

# 8-9 / 7/ 2019

## What happened?
Expectations wasn't communicated clearly 

## How you feel?
Frustrated at some point, but I become calm again :) 

## What have you learn?
* Do not play chinese whisper in work, nuances are lost in the process
* Do not be afraid of getting help

# 10 / 7 / 2019

## What happened?
N/A

## How you feel?
A bit relaxed

## What have you learn?
* Browser performs preflight request on behalf of user, but not for GET request, CORS is enforced on browser and with preflight request, the preflight req will be rejected and the real request wont be executed  
* There's something called [escape analysis](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/771430/escape-analysis-in-java) where JVM can figure out that you only need a part of a class and thus never fully instantiate the whole class

* Non-scientific Scala on JVM Performance tips:
    - Avoid allocation!!!
    - Use JVM primitive as much as possible
    - Macro is likely more performant than corresponding FP trick, case in point: Macro to produce Product type decoder is faster than using FreeApplicative, because it does most of the work at compile time, while FreeApplicative have to do work at runtime to extract data out from the F context and merge them and form a new F context
    
# 11-12 / 7 / 2019

## What happened?
Finally clean the backlog

## How you feel?
N/A

## What have you learn?

* Trying to reflect what is causing our work to get immensely more stressful:
    - We have more accountability, as a provider (think vendor), we suddenly have a lot more clients and each of them have different demand
    - We even get demand from our provider (wtf?) because of political reason, from technical perspective we want to use a service from A, but in reality A demands technical details from us, which is demanding for us as we really need to get details from A 1st
    - Build on top of guess/assumptions/ambiguity, we were forced to design with big uncertainty, this brings huge cognitive load and huge communication overhead because one always have to repeat assumption when progressing, and the fact that things are in the air means people can and will interpret them different, resulting in communication error which again take time and energy to fix
    - We were forced to sort everything out in one go (aka waterfall), without the appropriate equipment. We were forced to do something we aren't familiar with, which is to pre-plan everything because we had to answer people without them answering our ask
    - Agile is NOT a way to justify poor and late planning, while agile is being able to react quickly, such reaction should lives at the boundary of your deliverable. You should always KNOW what you are delivering NEXT, but it is fine to not know what is after that, and you should NOT change your deliverable on a daily basis, as that is just poor planning and poor commitment of business requirement. IMO, **the essence of Agile is to figure out how to fly while taking baby steps**.
    - Telephone game (or chinese whisper), communication by proxy is terrible in project management because it brings friction to decision making, decision making involves stakeholders and stakeholders are people that want something, and people who deliver that thing, put a middle who neither wanting that thing, and also not gonna deliver, and let him decide, and bingo, you not gonna get what you want 
* How you might have build a Free Monad?
    - Imagine you want to build a DSL, described as data, and given it is about computing, it almost always involves the notion of time (or order if you will), meaning you want to express the idea of  `Do A, then B`
    - Expressing `Do A, then B` is relatively straightforward, quite often, we also want to express the idea of doing things conditionally based on intermediate result, this means we need to express the idea of `getting intermediate result` AND the idea of `doing things AFTER getting the result`
    - to return a result, each steps can return some A
    - to choose next step using the result, each steps can have the notion of `next` which refers back to the sum type of all statement, this is powerful enough to express looping via recursion

# 13-16 / 7 / 2019
## What happened?
I dont remember

## How you feel?
Not bad

## What have you learn?

* AWS Lambda cold start is worsen by acquiring ENI in VPC
* A Category is a bunch of objects (can be zero), with arrows between them, arrow is formally known as morphism
* Each object has a identity morphism which points to itself
* Arrows compose
* Cold start of JVM Lambda can be reduced by using a different packaging strategy, but I dont know why?

## What happened?
I didn't write things down, because I was too exhausted with work and got lazy

## How you feel?
Frustrated
