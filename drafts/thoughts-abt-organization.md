## Efficient organization is like clean code

### The scaling pain of organization

Most organization started small, where all members were close and communication happens all the time.

Once organization grow to a certain level, one wont be able to have everything in one's head and this is the point where you start having to make abstractions to be able to leverage.

Like software, it is really difficult to introduce modularity as an afterthought.
