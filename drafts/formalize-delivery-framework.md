## Problem: The existing process of going from Idea to Specification is not efficient

I believe inefficiency comes from

1. Lack of a repeatable process/framework
2. Lack of a common language between Product/Business and Engineering

### Benefits of having a process

1. It promotes repeatability, having a process means less thing to think about, which improves productivity
2. It helps improvement, by having a process, we can iterate on it and improve it over time and benefit everyone.

### Benefits of having a common language

1. Less communication overhead/errors
2. Easier to reason about what is possible and what isn't

3. Api layers

Layer one always starts with a business case
Layer 2 expressed in terms on user interation
Layer 3 expressed in terms of answering question
