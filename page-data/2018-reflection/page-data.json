This means that I need to be more cautious when making decision, and strike a better balance between ensuring safety and making progress.</p>\n<h3>I learned a lot more about functional programming</h3>\n<p>I am thankful to be in the same team with Olivier, which he taught us a lot about functional programming. In addition, our team leads have been open with advanced technique which allow us to learn things on our job.</p>\n<h4>Recursion Schemes</h4>\n<p>I’ve learn some basic of recursion schemes, and manage to apply it in an open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/qingwei91/basil\">basil</a></p>\n<h4>Tagless Final</h4>\n<p>I am starting to appreciate interpreter pattern more. By separating definition and execution, one can gain a lot of power without paying huge refactoring cost.</p>\n<p>Example: Execute a program with <code class=\"language-text\">debounce</code> Effect to prevent rate limit exception from a remote API</p>\n<h3>Wrote an interesting library: <a href=\"https://github.com/qingwei91/basil\">basil</a></h3>\n<p>I wrote this library out of curiosity, and learn a lot in the process, I’ve learn about <code class=\"language-text\">higher kinded fix</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">FreeApplicative</code> and a lot more.</p>\n<p>It’s cool to (re)discover that I am most motivated when exploring new stuff, even if it’s not useful.</p>\n<h3>Reboot my own blog: <a href=\"https://qingwei91.github.io\">https://qingwei91.github.io</a></h3>\n<p>While my company blog undergone some changes which makes it harder to submit a blogpost, I decided to start my own blog again.</p>\n<p>I didn’t write as many blog as I wanted, let’s hope I will do it more in the coming year.</p>\n<h3>Formed a habit to gym</h3>\n<p>I am very happy that I am going to gym more often, it’s started to form a habit. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24/featured\">youtube channel</a> is one of my favorite channel about working out, thanks Jeff !</p>\n<h3>Enhanced my culinary skills</h3>\n<p>I enjoy cooking and have been trying out different recipes, hurray !</p>\n<h2>What went wrong?</h2>\n<h3>Investment went deep down, I mean deep down</h3>\n<p>I made a couple of big mistakes:</p>\n<p>a) Invest (speculate ?) without knowing how to make valuation\nb) Not knowing to cut-loss and take profit\nc) Putting all pressure on my wife which is an amateur</p>\n<p>these combined with uncertainty brought by trade war, and slow down of global economy means a bad year for our investment</p>\n<h3>Mistakes in work due to carelessness</h3>\n<p>I realized I get carried away rather easily, there’s a part of me that behaves like an enthusiastic dog that is eager to do whatever I am tasked to do :D</p>\n<p>While being enthusiastic is not a bad thing, it certainly isn’t an excuse for recklessness, I need to be more mindful when making decision or taking actions.</p>\n<h3>Fail to develop an arbitrage software I planned earlier of the year</h3>\n<p>I wanted to build an arbitrage engine but didn’t finish it, couple of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the project turns out to be quite difficult and messy due to external api changes</li>\n<li>I didn’t have a clear plan when developing</li>\n<li>It’s not as fun as I originally envision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I need to work on my energy management and be more focus on my goal, it’s ok to give up but there has to be a good reason</p>\n<h2>Action Points</h2>\n<h3>Improve my investment skills</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop a methodology to evaluate a stock</li>\n<li>Develop a strategy to take profit and cut loss</li>\n<li>Iterate the strategy by learning from historical actions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Be more careful and cautious</h3>\n<p>I think it’s hard to suddenly become a careful person, I can however starts with some actionable things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Double check a decision with experts</li>\n<li>Think thrice when pulling a dependency, a dependency is a backdoor waiting to happen</li>\n<li>Act slower when you’re dealing with something new that you aren’t familiar</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"My reflection for 2018","date":"December 25, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-reflection/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/scalameta-tut/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scalameta tutorial: Cache decorator"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/higher-fix/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fix point type for GADT (Scala)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
