Then we let the candidate to choose the right solution, and implement it in their programming language of choice.</p>\n<p>We can then discuss with the candidate about the solution and their train of thoughts.</p>\n<p>There are a few things we can tweak:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Obviously we can choose question that fit the domain of the role</li>\n<li>The choices, we should consider mixing correct and incorrect answer, optimal and non-optimal answer</li>\n<li>We can also choose the timing to present these options, maybe we let the candidate to try for the 1st 10 mins, then provide these options to help them</li>\n<li>You can also throw in code solution into the mix, if you want to assess candidate’s ability to read such code.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think this method should be a better way to assess candidate while sticking to coding interview. More often than not, a software engineer’s job is not to design novel algorithm but to understand existing algorithm, reason about it. Sometimes, we might also need to read some poorly written papers, understand it and codify the approach in our solution. So I think this approach will provide a better Signal/Noise ratio.</p>\n<p>I won’t be going into the pros and cons of coding interview, the fact is plenty of companies rely on them, and making it more useful should be a net-win. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Random thoughts on coding interview","date":"June 11, 2022"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/coding-interview/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code-readability/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Code Readability 9527"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/stateful-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Build Stateful with fs2, cats-effect"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
