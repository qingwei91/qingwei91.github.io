There is a downside to this workflow though, it can be quite annoying when you’re exploring the solution space as you dont know the algebra yet, so it can take a few iterations to get there. One alternative is to write scrappy code to explore more of the solution space before encoding them into proper algebra.</p>\n<p>TODO: I should try to find some examples to support my take.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Readability 9527","date":"May 24, 2022"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/code-readability/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/diff-levels-of-belief/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Different levels of beliefs"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/stateful-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Build Stateful with fs2, cats-effect"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
