# Another idea about Knowledge Organization

Lately I repeatedly bumped into knowledge management problem, there are a few pain points:

1. Different orgs store knowledge in different places
2. Search experience through knowledge base is lackluster
3. It is very difficult to organize knowledge into a structure that works for everyone

What if we have a tool that can pull in data (presumably text) from different places and present them in a single UI. Allow for fuzzy search, automatically annotate text and paragraph.

I think the solution to this problem is NLP powered federated search, it has to

1. Support powerful search 
2. Allow end user to correct keywords/tags/metadata
3. Able to suggest search query
4. Fast
5. Automatically annotate and extract keywords from text

## What components do we need?

1. A process to ingest text data from different source and convert into index
2. A UI to surface these information via a search interface
3. 

## Action plan

[ ] - Survey friends and industry on how they manage knowledge
[ ] - Design a program that extract keywords and concepts from text

## Notes

This idea is now progressing into my personal project
