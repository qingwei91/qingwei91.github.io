## Why Knowledge Graph isn't more common?

Organized knowledge refers to a way to model knowledge in computer system, it models relationship between concepts, objects, events and situations. To read more, search `Ontology in computer science`.

This didn't happen more because 

* querying knowledge is hard
* does not have a killer use case for small to medium data set 

### Query knowledge is hard

Knowledge is a bags of concepts and facts that connects to each other via all kind of relationships, due to all the ways things can be connected, it is not easy to query it effectively, you face the problem of `you dont know what you dont know`. In reality, you probably want to learn things by guided exploration instead of query.

Guided exploration is hard to build as it is highly context-specific.

### No killer use case for its complexity

There isn't as much use cases as I originally thought, for example, if you want to learn what does a `term` means, you can use knowledge graph to answer that, or you can maintain a list of words with their description and call it a day.

Knowledge graph is starting to shine when you want to derive knowledge, but for most common use-cases, there are simpler solutions for it.

I need to think more about the use-cases, what is the point? what problem does it solve?
