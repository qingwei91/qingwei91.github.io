## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is created to solve the problem of binary classification. To classify instances into 2 categories.

Linear regression cannot model binary outcome because there's no constraint on the result, normally noted as Y.

But we know how to optimize Linear Regression, thus the idea is to find a way to convert a binary classification problem into a Linear regression problem.

### The sigmoid curve

In a binary classification problem, Ys are distributed on 0 and 1, we can imagine there's a S-shaped line that divides the Y properly based on whether it is 0 or 1.

We want to find such a line

### Transform sigmoid curve to linear curve

Sigmoid curve is not linear and thus we dont know how to manipulate it to improve, but we know how to improve a linear curve.

So we want to convert sigmoid curve to a linear one.
