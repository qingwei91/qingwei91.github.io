# Information Retrieval

Information retrieval is concern of finding relevant documents from a corpus given a query. It is an old field in computing, or even pre-computing. I am gaining interest lately due to the rise of Transformer, and related technologies like BERT that greatly improve machine's ability to comprehend Natural Language, which happens to be the most common corpus available.
