# Decision 

As an engineering lead, I have to make technical decisions, they are framed in such a way:

For every decisions, we should ask some problems:

1. What is the risk profile of the context, are we pursuing high-risk/high-reward or low-risk/low-reward, this is important as it limits the decisions you can make
2. Do we have enough confidence that the problem is relevant?
3. Is the decision reversible?
4. What are the consequences if the decision is wrong?

## Some general principles:

Principles are used as tie breaker when you find it hard to make a decision, for example in case where all else being equal

1. Prefer Cheap Experiment over abstract argument
1. Prefer action that might lead to failure over non-decision 
1. Prefer amplifying coworkers over individual's convenience

## For engineering problem

1. Can the system be understood by people easily?
2. Is the system easy to change?
3. Can we further reduce communication overhead? (At what cost?)
