# Statistics

## Basics

* Observations means data set
* Numerical vs Categorical
* Continuous vs Discrete
* Nominal vs Ordinal
* Population vs Sample
* Always try to sample randomly
* Observational study vs Experiment (Uncontrolled vs controlled)
* Observational study is prone to confounding factor, researcher need to design to avoid confounding factor
* Simple Random Sampling is costlier
* Stratified sampling - group data by a trait, then employ random sampling within each group, downside is it is harder to analyze the result
* Cluster sampling - group data into clusters and pick a few cluster as sample, all observations within selected clusters are used

## Principles of Experiment design

1. Controlling - control differences
2. Randomization
3. Replication
4. Blocking - actively block confounder

## Plotting tips

1. Use scatter plot to find relationship between 2 variables
2. Histogram is used to group data into bins
3. Right skewed means mode at left
4. Box plot is useful to know distribution and outlier
5. Use log transformation to minimize difference
6. For categorical data, use bar plot, segmented bar and mosaic plot
7. Side by side box plot can be used to compare data from different group

## Variance and std dev
Definition: Sum of differences of each observation with mean

We can describe how far a data is away from mean using std dev, eg. X1 is 2 std dev away from mean

## Rejecting null hypothesis

Often, rejecting null hypothesis is the goal of research.

One way to approach it is by simulating the scenario using null hypothesis and match it with the real data, if it is extremely rare to produce data matching real data, then we can reject null hypothesis in favor of alternatie hypothesis

## Probability

* Disjoint events mean they are mutually exclusive
* A process can produce an outcome
* A set of outcomes is typically called an event
* Probability Addition Rule: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
* Probability distribution = all disjoint outcomes with their corresponding probability, sum = 1
* Marginal probabilities = prob based on single variable
* Joint prob = prob based on more than 1 variable
