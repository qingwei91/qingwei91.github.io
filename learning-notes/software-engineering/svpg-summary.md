I attempt to summarize some of the viewpoints from Sillicon Valley Product Group, from Marty Cagan

Here's the original [link](https://svpg.com/team-objectives-overview/)

## Feature Team vs Product Team

Feature team implements a solution, whereas Product Team solves a business problem.

One key differentiator is the success criteria of the team.

Feature team should be judged based on how fast and how cheap they implement the solution, but they should not be accountable for the outcome of their solutions as long as it fulfill the requirements.

Product team should be judged based on the outcome they are required to deliver.

### How to create Product Team?

1. Team should focus on the problem, not about the feature to build
2. Team should have strategic context to deeply understand the why

Letting a team to solve a problem rather than build a feature is important because:
1. We want to let the team to own the problem, to be responsible and accountable for the business outcome, this is only achievable if they fully understand the problem we are solving
2. If the solution does not solve the problem, the team know that it has to iterate until they solve the problem, or declared the problem cannot be solved, either way, they have to make such decision.

### Product team and OKR

Remember that Product team solves problem, and this is typically expressed as your objective, good objective should tied to your business model and metrics.

Leadership is responsible to assign objectives to teams.

With an objective, you should typically have 2 key results:
A primary key result to measure your objective, and a second one to act as a measure of quality to make sure we dont inadvertently hurt something else.

For example, to boost revenue one solution is to giving out stuff for free or lower than the cost, but this is harmful to business. There are other more subtle cases, and it is up to the team to identify potential issue when setting key results.

The team should be the one that come up with exact KPI, as they are the one owning them, and for new project, it is typical to spend some time to better understand the problems dynamic to discover the right measure.

When deciding key results, the team may need weeks or months to learn the space before coming up with reasonable key results, this normally happens when the team is working on a new area.

The team will also need guidance from leadership on how ambitious or conservative they should be, this is important when the problem is hard and/or nobody in the organization has solved a similar problem before.

Next, it is important for Leader to make sure product team and the rest of organization are aligned, this means all related parties are ready to support the product team to achieve their goal.

### Product Strategy

Product team is suppose to execute your organization product strategy.

Product strategy is how one is planning to accomplish the goals.

It should covers:
1. How to make tough choices on what's really important
2. Generating, identifying and leveraging insights
3. Converting Insights to actions
4. Action management without micro-management
