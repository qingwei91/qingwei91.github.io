# Data Structure

## Array
- Continuous block of data in memory
- O(1) random access
- Fixed size
- Finding max/min or by value is O(n), unless array is sorted
- Append element is O(1)
- Insert element in the middle of array is O(n)
- Replace element by index is O(1)
- Remove element by index that is not at the end is O(n), because it requires moving elements behind 

## Stack
- Support First in First out
- Push and Pop are both O(1)
- Can be implemented by Array

## Single Linked List
- Elements are linked by pointer
- O(n) random access
- O(1) to access 1st element
- Remove
