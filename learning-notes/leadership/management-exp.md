# Some notes on technique and principle I've learned as a manager

## Principles

### Be transparent
Proactively provide transparency, put in effort so that my team understand my priority, focus and how I spent time.

### Emphasis on clarity
Clarity in project goal, big picture, daily communication. It is important to point out when we lack clarity, if we lack clarity, all of us should be aware and be clear on that.

## Techniques

### Design Review
Design review is important, it can be done by enforcing design proposal followed by review process.

### Continuous tech-debt
With a large enough team, we can have a schedule where every cycle someone solely focus on improving technical issue.

### Knowing each other
Team canvas can be useful, and obviously 1-1 is crucial
