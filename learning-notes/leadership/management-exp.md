## Principles

### Be transparent
Proactively provide transparency, put in effort so that my team understand my priority, focus and how I spent time.

### Emphasis on clarity
Clarity in project goal, big picture, daily communication. It is important to point out when we lack clarity, if we lack clarity, all of us should be aware and be clear on that.

### Prioritize and focus
The role of manager demands great skill of prioritization and focus, in a dynamic and complex environment. One have to figure out what is the most important thing to focus on, and for how long, while get numerous distraction from different party that all tries to grab your attention.

Your typical responsibilities include:

1. Project Delivery
2. Facilitate technical discussion and decision
3. Hiring which sometimes requires design the whole or part of interview process
4. Handling issues raised by Customer, which typically demands priority and disrupt existing workflow
5. Reporting, depends on organization, some org demands more reporting which can be counter-productive
6. People development, this can be a small or huge undertaking depending on your team and your commitment

## Techniques
