I had my 1st therapy session.

Some key points:

## To find back my interest

While he said its good that I am trying new stuff with dear, I should still look at things I truly enjoy, I can use my childhood as inspiration.

I used to enjoy DOTA, card games, chess. I also enjoy basketball but that's more like having accompany. I think I like to show that I am capable, better, outstanding.

Games allow me to outsmart opponent (when I am good at it).

I also like reading, novel, comics, opinion, anything.

## My behavior and childhood

I shared my childhood and my perception with it, my remark is sarcrifices and uni-direction loathsome. I also said there was always expectation of excel to not be looked down on.

Also, my dad personality might have affected by his family, sisters, and possibly mom.

Therapist pointed out that I am doing something like my mom. This is quite an insight.
