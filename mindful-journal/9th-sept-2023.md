Had a chat with therapist.

He is trying to remind me about being my authentic self, I have been relatively happy in the past few weeks because I am seeing her getting better and cheerful. But what about myself? what gets me excited and happy?

I think solving problem is one, providing value like doing something well is another.
I like coding up solutions that I like, or making good designs. I also like to learn new stuff that I can apply in real world, which is why I like cooking.

I also like to deal with abstract questions, one that makes us think about life in general or just tinker for the sake of it, playing go is a good way, although I probably should play with people more.
