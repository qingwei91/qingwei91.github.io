Looks like my dear does not want to hear my heart. I think I knew this and that's why I dont dare to tell her stuff.

This is unhealthy, I think I need to be less scared.

Is this because her over-reliant on our relationship?

I always felt she isn't honest to herself or me, but acting like she is very sure and have already thought out.
